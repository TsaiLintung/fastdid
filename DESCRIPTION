Description: **fastdid** is a fast implementation of Callaway and Sant'Anna's (2021)<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303948> staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators and its extensions. **Fastdid** not only reduces the computation time from hours to seconds, but also incorporates new extensions to the framework such as time-varying covariates<https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02903> and double event<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YSZR9moWq2GS9AeKeGEi9ytkbJzwI3gs/view?usp=drive_link>.
